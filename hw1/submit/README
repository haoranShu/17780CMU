The implementation of the API is in permGenerator.java.
Unit test(s) are in UnitTest.java.
Two sets of client code are in the other two files.

1. Compile the code with command

javac *.java

2. Run UnitTest you can see it prints "Tests passed."

3. basicClient generates all permutations of four elements without and with a predicate. Running
   it would print out permutations generated and the number of permutations generated.

4. concurrentClient generates all permutations of 10 numbers using 3 threads. It is going to
   print out the total number of permutations generated by each thread.
